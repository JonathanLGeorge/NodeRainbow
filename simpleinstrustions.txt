to launch local host go to terminal and navigate to directory
then type: node idex.js to host on localhost:####
open up web browser :)


whats going on under the hood:

we have file index.js... its basically the server
what does it do? hosts static files (index.html)
its listening for computers to request these files and serves them up
index.js can also be responsibile to save to data base
authentication


something we can only do on client is geo locate so we need to write that
code on index.html using javascript

web api Navigator for client side
